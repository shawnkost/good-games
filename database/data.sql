values ('28', 'The story telling of the game is top notch and the atmosphere is great, but I bought this game after sinking tons of time into the original Red Dead so that was expected. What was not expected was just how completely awful the controls and mechanics of this game are. The gun fighting felt clunky and underdeveloped, gunfights without cover are pointless because the enemies demolish you, NPCs start fights with you and shoot if you accidentally get in their way on the road, the main character needs to play fetch and do chores after every mission, and the home camp is apparently completely incapable of doing anything for themselves. The worst part is that I will bet the cost of the game that once online comes out single player wont get a single update to fix the clear and present issues. As is, this game deserves nowhere near a 97 rating and it is pretty clear how and why it is getting that kind of rating.', '1');
